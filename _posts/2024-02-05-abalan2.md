I am visualizing the effect of performing non-linear dimensionality reduction (TSNE) on varying number of PCs.  The gene 
expression was normalized (by total gene expression for each cell) prior to PCA. t-SNE was then performed by using all PCs, first 
30 PCs only, first 4 PCs only and first 2PCs only. 

### What data types are you visualizing?
Panel A visualizes standard deviation (quantitative) and it's value for each PC (ordinal data). 
Panel B visualizes the location of each cell (spatial ) in the reduced feature space from PCA (PC1 v PC2) as well as the variation 
in the normalized expression  KRT7 gene (quantitative).  
Panels C-F visualize the location of each cell on the reduced feature space from tSNE (embedding 1 v embedding 2) as well as the 
variation in the normalized expression of KRT7 gene (quantitative)

### What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
Panel A: The geometric primitive used is points (for standard deviation) and the visual channel used is the position on the y-axis 
for standard deviation and position on x-axis for PC index. 
Panels B-F: The geometric primitive used is points  (for the spatial location of each cell after PCA or tSNE) and the visual 
channel used is color (hue) to indicate the normalized expression of KRT7 gene 

### What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 

Through this visualization I am trying to emphasize the effect of performing tSNE on varying number of PCs. The PCA screen plot in 
panel A represents the variance in the data, captured by each of the PCs. The visualizations in panels B shows the expression of 
KRT7 gene in the PC space. 

Panels  C-F show the expression of KRT7 when tSNE is performed on all PCs, first 30 PCs only, first 4 PCs only and first 2 PCs 
only respectively. It can be seen that panels C and D are comparable and hence running tSNE only on first 30 PCs and panels E and 
F are more similar to each other.

### What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?

The Gestalt principle of similarity is used to visualize cells that express a similar proportion of genes and principle of 
proximity is used as similar cells are located closer together in the reduced feature space.
