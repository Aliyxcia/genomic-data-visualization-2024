## What data types are you visualizing?
I am visualizing quantitative data of the expression count of the VCAN gene for each spot, and spatial data regarding the aligned x and y positions for each spot.

## What data encodings are you using to visualize these data types?
I am using the geometric primitive of points to represent each spot on the spatial gene expression slide. To encode the quantitative expression count of the VCAN gene, I am using the visual channel of saturation going from an unsaturated light grey to a saturated red. To encode the spatial aligned x position, I am using the visual channel of position along the x axis. To encode the spatial aligned y position, I am using the visual channel of position along the y axis. 

## What type of data visualization is this? What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? What Gestalt principles have you applied towards achieving this goal if any?
This data visualization is a scatter plot. My explanatory data visualization seeks to make more salient the relationship between VCAN expression and the aligned x and y position of the spot. I have applied the Gestalt principle of enclosure to separate the color encoding legend from the plot with a box. The Gestalt principle of similarity is also used to identify areas of similar VCAN gene expression, since they will have similar color saturation.

## Please share the code you used to reproduce this data visualization.
```{r}
data <-
    read.csv("genomic-data-visualization-2024/data/eevee.csv.gz",
             row.names = 1)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(
    x = aligned_x,
    y = aligned_y,
    size = 0.1,
    col = VCAN,
)) +
    scale_colour_gradient(low = 'lightgrey', high = 'red') +
    geom_point() +
    guides(size = FALSE) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.background = element_rect(size = 0.5,
                                           colour = 1))
```
