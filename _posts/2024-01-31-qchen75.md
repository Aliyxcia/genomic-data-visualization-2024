### Whose code are you applying? 
Connie C (*cchen260*)

### Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?
My classmate was to make salient **the spots with cells that express WRN and RECQL4 and to what extent compared to other spots**.
I think the visualization worked fine for the original dataset my classmate was using, since the x and y positions are more on the discrete ends so that points don't overlap with each other. The visualization seems self-evident in expressing the spatial information.
However, the color gradient used is slightly disturbing as it does not distinguish well between no expression and one expression (which means different things). I would like to change the color gradient and make the non-expressing cells transparent for better contrast.
In addition, since my classmate is not trying to make saliant **the correlation between WRN and RECQL4**, two separate plots with the same encoding should be used instead of two different encodings on a single plot.
