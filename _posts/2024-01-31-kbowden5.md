**1) Whose code did you apply?**
I applied the code jwang428 wrote for the previous homework assignment.

**2) **

```{r}
#note that the code and the file are in the same directory
data <- read.csv('pikachu.csv.gz', row.names = 1)
dim(data)
data[1:10, 1:10]
colnames(data)

#if it is not already installed
install.packages("viridis")

#access necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)

#generate the plot
ggplot(data)+
  geom_point(aes(x=GATA3, y = FOXA1, col = nucleus_area, size = cell_area))+
  scale_color_viridis_c()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "FOXA1 and GATA3 Impact on Cell and Nucleus Area",
       x = "GATA3",
       y = "FOXA1") 
```
