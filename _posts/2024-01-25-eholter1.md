### What data types are you visualizing?
I am visualizing quantitative data of the number of unique genes expressed in each cell, as well as spatial data including the x and y centroid positions of each cell.

### What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
I am using points as the geometric primitive to represent each individual cell. I am encoding the spatial x position through the visual channel of position along the x axis. I am encoding the spatial y position through the visual channel of position along the y axis. To encode the number of unique genes expressed for each cell, I am using the visual channel of color saturation, with unsaturated white representing the lowest extreme and saturated red representing the highest extreme.

### What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 
I am trying to make the relationship between cell position within the tissue and number of unique genes expressed more salient. Different types of cells express different numbers of genes, and this can also change in states of disease, such as in cancer. I aimed to illustrate if any regions of the tissue had clusters of cells similarly expressing significantly more or fewer genes, thus possibly denoting a specific type of cell or cells in a certain state.

### What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
I am using the Gestalt principle of similarity by grouping cells expressing a similar number of unique genes with the same color.
