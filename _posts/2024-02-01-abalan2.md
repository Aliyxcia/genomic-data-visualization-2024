### Whose code are you applying? 
I am applying Esther's code of visualizing spatial variation in CD4 gene expression to the pikachu 
dataset.


### Critique the resulting visualization when applied to your data. 
The resulting visualization fulfils the original objective of showing the 
spatial variation in the expression of the CD4 genes.

### Do you think the author was effective in making salient the point they said they wanted to make? 
Yes, the initial visualization emphasizes areas of high versus low CD4 
expression. The author's choice to add transparency in addition to 
saturation helps emphasize the spatial patterns of high versus low CD4 
expression. 

### How could you improve the data visualization in making salient the point they said they wanted to make?If you donâ€™t think the data visualization can be improved, explain why the data visualization is already effective

While the visualization helps differentiate high versus low CD4 
expression,the very low transparency makes it hard to visualize the areas of low 
expression, especially when the code is adapted for the smFISH dataset. Scaling up the transparency may help improve the saliency of the visualization.
