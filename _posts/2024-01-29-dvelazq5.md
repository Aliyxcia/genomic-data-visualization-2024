[description]
For my data visualization, I analyzed 15 different genes and displayed the proportion of genes expressed in a certain spot, also showing their location.
I have spatial data that I'm visualizing (x,y), as well as categorical data for each gene, and numerical data for the count
of each gene in a spot. For geometric primitives, I am using points (but looks like a line) to represent each spatial data point, and area to show the genes 
expressed at that point and how many are expressed. For visual channels, I am using hue to show the different types of genes expressed at each point, and size
to show the quantitative proportion of genes expressed at that point, and the shape of a rectangle (but looks like a line) to represent a spot. I am trying to
make salient the different types of genes expressed at each spatial location and see where certain genes are more expressed than others. I used my scatterbar
package (which I developed in an internship, however, I see with the vast amount of spots present, it is tough to get a clear picture, suggesting 
that further improvements could be made). Gestalt principles I used were similarity, with each gene associated with a hue in the scatterbar, and also continuity 
(at least I tried), with each spot being represented by a stacked bar chart of different colors to show the proportions adding up to 1 and what is expressed 
at that spot.
