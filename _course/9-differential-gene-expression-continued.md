# Lecture 9

## 9.0 Lesson learning objectives

We will also continue performing differential expression analysis. We will learn how to create different data visualizations to summarize our analysis, and use these visualizations and summaries to evaluate our analysis pipeline.

# Hands-on component 9

Our in-class hands-on component will analyze our spatial transcriptomics dataset to identify differentially expressed genes and make data visualizations.
