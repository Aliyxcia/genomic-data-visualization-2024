# Lecture 12

## 12.0 Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should be able to understand spatial transcriptomics technologies based on spot-based capture and sequencing, how they can work, and begin analyzing some data. 

### Spatially resolved transcriptomic sequencing with Visium 

Visium is a commercial platform that uses glass slides with arrayed oligonucleotides containing positional barcodes to generate cDNA libraries with positional information for RNA sequencing. The technique was introduced in the paper [*Stahl et al. Visualization and analysis of gene expression in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics. Science (2016)*]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/readings/stahl-et-al_science-aaf2403.pdf) and later licensed to 10X Genomics for commercialization.

# Homework Assignment 12

Analyze the Visium dataset. Perform analyses and create a multi-panel data visualization with a corresponding ‘figure caption’ that describes your data visualization.
